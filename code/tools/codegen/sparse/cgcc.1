.SH NAME
cgcc \- Compiler wrapper to run Sparse after compiling
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cgcc
[\fISPARSE OPTIONS\fR]... [\fICOMPILER OPTIONS\fR]... [\fIINPUT FILES\fR]...
.br
.B make CC=cgcc
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcgcc\fR provides a wrapper around a C compiler (\fBcc\fR by
default) which also invokes the Sparse static analysis tool.
.P
\fBcgcc\fR accepts all Sparse command-line options, such as warning
options, and passes all other options through to the compiler.
.P
By providing the same interface as the C compiler, \fBcgcc\fR allows
projects to run Sparse as part of their build without modifying their
build system, by using \fBcgcc\fR as the compiler.  For many projects,
setting \fBCC=cgcc\fR on the \fBmake\fR command-line will work.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B REAL_CC
If set, \fBcgcc\fR will use this as the compiler to invoke, rather
than the default \fBcc\fR.
.
.TP
.B CHECK
If set, \fBcgcc\fR will use this as the Sparse program to invoke,
rather than the default \fBsparse\fR.
